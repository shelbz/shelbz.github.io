	<h1>ORGANIZING?!?!</h1>
	<hr>
	<h2>I <strong>organize</strong> / "organize" / <i>organize?</i>, largely with students and youth, as parts of larger movements for racial and economic justice and for a better world.  The first time I remember learning about "organizing," I was 17 and enrapt in religious awakening.  I read about <a href="http://www.catholicworker.org/dorothyday/ddbiographytext.cfm?Number=3">Dorothy Day's</a> sharp analysis and devout faith lived out in decades of writing about and working for "a revolution of the heart, a revolution that must begin with each one of us."  I was intrigued by the Catholic Worker movement with which she was associated, creating communities of people working for radical alternatives to capitalism.  Three years later, I was writing grants for a soup kitchen and addiction recovery [social service] nonprofit when I stumbled across an article about the <a href="http://ciw-online.org/">Coalition of Immokalee Workers</a> and their incredible gains for farmworkers' rights, won by workers organizing together and inviting allies to work alongside them.  Though I was working for this organization (and had engaged in similar social service work and learning in the past) through an interest in economic and racial justice which stemmed from my faith and other connections, I had never been involved in organizing before.  I decided to answer the invitation at the bottom of the article and call the CIW office.  They in turn put me in touch with students organizing in solidarity with workers fighting for their rights in Rhode Island.  I have learned so much from my experience of "organizing" -- my life is so enriched by the relationships I have formed, a deepened understanding and analysis of how the world works and my own position in it, feeling of power at being able to change things with other people ... <style><strong>I would like to try to begin to share what "organizing" is with you.   So, after a brief introduction from me, I have made the <a href="http://www.sfalliance.org/resources/Strategy%20chart%202006.pdf">Midwest Academy's GROW Strategy Chart</a> (a guide to campaign planning) and the <a href="http://warresisters.org">War Resisters</a> guide to youth organizing more interactive.</strong></style></h2>
