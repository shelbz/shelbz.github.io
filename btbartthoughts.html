	<!Could also try to do an art announcement website: check it out this evening if it is feasible and then check in with Lis-Marie about doing it.  I could make them sortable by type, submission date.  The sorting could be really nice, and the blurbs could pop up over the art, with an about the artist and why they did the piece (why is this important to them?  why is their liberation tied up in farmworkers' liberation and in the liberation of Wendys?  what is the new world they envision?  Celebration of student/youth solidarity and power) and about their Fair Food Group.  Tab that leads to BtB website, submission tab as well.  Also a print function so people can print them out for their wall or to pass out at Wendy's @wendys #BootTheBraids.  Also a retweet and facebook share function.  Also an 'original for sale' function because MAKING ART IS VALUABLE!>

	<!Can I build in a tool where people can brandbust Wendy's like with those memes: tool built into the website where they can make it and share it. // or have a collection of selfies and be continually throwing them at Wendy's, or have a collection of articles on our website - why students and youth should and do support Wendy's joining the Fair Food Program - seems like Boot the Braids website may be this.>
